# reviewWUSMexternalmodule
An external module for REDCap to be reviewed by the community


The project is intended to be used to copy data upon save from a Source project into another Destination project. Naturally the two projects must have identical field and structure layouts, or the copy will fail.  

Imagine use case is something along the lines of, Source project may be some data entry project and the Destination may be some reporting project.  The Destination may have some fields that should not show what the Source project has, perhaps some PHI data may be excluded or just some other data for some reason is not needed to be reported in the Destination.
